Reason: Abstract and formal tasks that are among the most difficult mental undertakings for a human being are among the easiest for a computer.

Challenge to simple machine learning: The performance of simple machine learning algorithms depends heavily on the representation of the data they are given. 
A solution: Representation learning. 

Goal of representation learning: To separate the factors of variation that explain the observed data. Factors: Sources of influence, can be thought of as concepts or abstractions that help us make sense of the rich variability of the data.

Challenge to representation learning: Disentangle the factors of variation and discard the ones that we do not care about.
A solution: Deep learning. 

Method: Introducing representations that are expressed in terms of other, simpler representations.

Two main ways of measuring the depth of a mode:
1. The depth of the computational graph.
2. the depth of the graph describing how concepts are related to each other. It is used by deep probabilistic models,
